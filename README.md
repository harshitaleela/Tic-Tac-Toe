This is a basic implementation of a Tic-tac-toe AI designed for a 5x5 grid, with the player who is able to succesfully place 4 in a row wins. The AI has been implemened using minimax algorithm and alpha beta pruning.

The algorithm checks upto next 5 levels in the game tree to decide the next optimal move, so as to reduce the runtime while still maintaining efficiency of decisions. The algorithm is still slow and can be improved by including various modifications like history heuristics and transposition tables.
